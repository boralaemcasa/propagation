I've searched "newspaper"
I've found BBC.
I've sent this text below.
Could you reply me?

Dear ones,

I want to post an announce like this one:

"I look for a maximum of 29 year-old woman to live with me in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. I'm a mathematics teacher, a computer technician and a public servant." Vinícius Claudino Ferraz. boralaemcasa@gmail.com +55 31 98526 7474, +55 19 999 173650 www.claudino.webs.com sites.google.com/site/mathspirituality

How to proceed?

Which documents do you need?

Well, I'm sending this message above for some newspapers.
Because I tried to announce at "super noticia" at belo horizonte for over four years.

Since december 2015, I'm trying to announce at "folha de são paulo", which is a Brazilian national newspaper.
Nobody is calling me. I suppose I'm defamed in the whole country.

I'm Spiritist.

Sincerely,

Vinícius
